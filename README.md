# An ImageJ plugin to manually correct XY drift on microscope timelapses.

This plugin will help you quickly correct the XY drift on microscope timelapses. All you will have to do is to:

1. Draw one or more rectangle ROIs around your objects of interest. These ROIs will be used to crop the original timelapse.
2. Track a fixed point of your sample: this can be your object of interest, a fiducial marker present on the coverglass, or anything else.

Of course manual tracking can be long and tedious, but for quick tests it might be a better option than setting up an automatic tracking tool. That being said, you can always use this *Manual drift corrector* plugin with automated tracking data.
